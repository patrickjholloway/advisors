Q: Overall, provide your response, questions, and guidance to your colleagues.

A: Hi there,

The designs look great. I have few questions and feedback items:

- We should probably have a button to include a way to reset all filters. I would consider this to be required for an MVP.
- Right now we have 100 advisors, but we may have many more in the future. I think it would be beneficial for
performance to have pagination or infinite scrolling down the road when we have many more.
- Can we get a design for how this page should look on a smaller mobile device? A horizontal list view would probably be
more appropriate if we have to scale it down.

Q: What additional information is needed to begin implementation?

- Are there designs for the filter chips when they have filters active?
- Should we have pagination, free text search or sorting? (sort or group by location for example).
I think for v1 we should be okay without any of these.
- What should the reset filters button look like?
- Should there be a summary of active filters without opening the modals for each individual filter?
- Should the location and specialties filters reuse the checkbox design that is in the Figma for Certifications?
- What should the loading state look like?
- What should this page look like when there are no results?
- If the page refreshes should the filters remain in place?

Q: Write an initial development plan that outlines a breakdown of the steps necessary to complete this feature.

- Write code to fetch the data we are presenting
- Create the component for the Advisor Cards
- Create the list view
- Create Filter modal interface, if these all work the same way we may be able to reuse a single component
- Add the state management neccesary to have the filters applied
- Write integration tests for loading page and interacting with filters

Q: If you were submitting this work as an actual PR to a production repo to be reviewed by a peer, what additional information would you communicate to them?

There are some advisors in the data that don't have names. We should try to clean up that data and ask design/product what we should do when we don't have that data or if we should always be able to assume it will be present.

We should consider this a first pass and perhaps ship what we have behind a feature flag until it is ready for customers.

Q: Describe at least two particular limitations of your approach: What canâ€™t it handle that we might need to address? Why did you make that choice? What are the alternatives?

We should try to handle pagination and text search soon. They were not in scope for this story but may be important for usability and performance.

We also may not want to use Mantine so much going forward if we don't agree on its usage as a team. We should talk to the design team to figure out what our requirements are for a component library and then discuss options as a front-end development team.

Q: Write a brief summary of what you would do next if you had more time.

I would work on getting the filters implemented.
