Q: Overall, provide your response, questions, and guidance to your colleagues.

A: Hi there,

The designs look great. I have few questions and feedback items:

- We should probably have a button to include a way to reset all filters. I would consider this to be required for an MVP.
- Right now we have 100 advisors, but we may have many more in the future. I think it would be beneficial for
performance to have pagination or infinite scrolling down the road when we have many more.
- Can we get a design for how this page should look on a smaller mobile device? A horizontal list view would probably be
more appropriate if we have to scale it down.

Q: What additional information is needed to begin implementation?

- Are there designs for the filter chips when they have filters active?
- Should we have pagination, free text search or sorting? (sort or group by location for example).
I think for v1 we should be okay without any of these.
- What should the reset filters button look like?
- Should there be a summary of active filters without opening the modals for each individual filter?
- Should the location and specialties filters reuse the checkbox design that is in the Figma for Certifications?
- What should the loading state look like?
- What should this page look like when there are no results?
- If the page refreshes should the filters remain in place?

Q: Write an initial development plan that outlines a breakdown of the steps necessary to complete this feature.

- Write code to fetch the data we are presenting
- Create the component for the Advisor Cards
- Create the list view
- Create Filter modal interface, if these all work the same way we may be able to reuse a single component
- Add the state management neccesary to have the filters applied
